# SOLID principles

Is collection of principles which complements each other and helps in creating simple and better software which is easy to change and maintain.

## List of principles
- `S - Single Responsibility Principle`
- `O - Open Closed Principle`
- `L - Liskov Substitution Principle`
- `I - Interface Segregation Principle`
- `D - Dependency Inversion Principle`


## About 5 principles:
### S - SRP - (Single Responsibility Principle)
> `A Class/Object should have only one responsibility.`
- In other words a class should have only one reason to change.

### O - OCP - (Open and Closed Principle)
> `A class should only be open for extension, not for any modification.`

### L - LSP - (Liskov Substitution Principle)
> `A Parent class must always be replaceable by its Derived class.`


### I - ISP - (Interface Segregation Principle)
> `Class/interface should be in a way that users are not forced to implement unnecessary feature/methods.`


### D - DIP - (Dependency Inversion Principle)
> `Entity must depend on abstraction not on concretion.` 
- In other words high level class(or module/methods/functions) must not be depend on low level details.
- Allows use to segregate dependencies so that they can be easily changed something like used data source and database. 



## PS
*Note:* A word of caution they are powerful but can be overkill so use it wisely and don't oversimplify your code.
