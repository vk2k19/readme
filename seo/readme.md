# SEO

SEO is acronym for Search engine optimization

## Search Engine

A search engine is a program available on the internet, used by many individuals to find content they're interested in. For instance, Google.com is the default search engine on Google Chrome, utilized by many to find videos, images, blogs, websites, etc.

### Common Steps To Access Content Over Internet

- GIVEN you as a user have a digital device with internet access,
- THEN you open a web browser or application (e.g., Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.),
- AND access a search engine interface like google.com, yahoo.com, bing.com, etc.,
- THEN you enter a word or sentence such as "Why is SEO important," "Tips on blogging," "Hotels near me," etc.,
- THEN the search engine provides a list of relevant options,
- THEN you choose content from the list.

Note: You might trigger a search directly via the search engine by entering terms in your browser input field. For example, you can add a term in Google to search or a web address to directly open it.
